# Text licences

Every text in Verses Across is public domain or carries an open licence. Each version also lives in
`data/catalog.json` (name, year, translator, licence, source URL), which is the complete list, and its
attribution is shown under the text in the reader. The table below covers the Bibles. Licences were
checked on the eBible.org details page and catalog on 2026-11-03.

**One non-commercial text:** the William Davidson Talmud (English, via Sefaria) is **CC BY-NC**. That is
fine because Verses Across is free, with no ads and no purchases. If that ever changes, this text must
be removed or licensed first. Every other text allows commercial use.

These licences cover the texts only. The app's own code is under the AGPL (see `LICENSE` and `README.md`).

## Notes and flags

- **KJV in the United Kingdom:** letters patent give Cambridge University Press, Oxford University Press
  and Collins exclusive rights to *print* the KJV in the UK. eBible.org states the restriction has no
  effect outside the UK. Get legal advice before any commercial UK launch.
- **BBE:** public domain in the US because it was published there without a copyright notice. Its status
  elsewhere is less clear. Low risk for a free site; confirm before any commercial use outside the US.
- **Formatting only, no wording changes:** square brackets used to mark supplied words are removed, and
  whitespace is normalised.
- **Versification:** every version is aligned to the KJV verse grid so columns line up. The reviewed maps
  are in `data/versification/<version>.json`, proposed by `scripts/suggest-versification.ts` (length
  alignment with verse-number evidence). Where a version numbers a verse differently, its own number is
  shown next to the text. Verses with no KJV counterpart appear as extra rows (e.g. "3a"). Whole extra
  chapters (Psalm 151, the Greek and Latin additions to Esther and Daniel) are set aside for the
  Apocrypha & Deuterocanon section.
- **Septuagint sections not yet aligned:** Jeremiah 25–51, Proverbs 24–31, Exodus 35–40 and
  1 Kings 20–21 are ordered differently in the LXX. They are left out of the Greek column, with a note,
  until a reordering table is added (Phase 4).
- **Not included:** no public-domain Almeida (Portuguese) or Delitzsch Hebrew NT is available on
  eBible.org, so Bíblia Livre (CC BY 4.0) and Salkinson–Ginsburg are used instead.

## Apocrypha & Deuterocanon (added Nov 2026)

Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Sirach, Baruch (with the Letter of Jeremiah as chapter 6 in the KJV and
Vulgate), 1–2 Maccabees, 1 Esdras, Susanna and Bel and the Dragon, plus 3–4 Maccabees (Greek only).
- **KJV** – the 1611 Apocrypha in eBible.org's KJV (eng-kjv), public domain (UK caveat above).
- **WEB** – Old and New Testaments unchanged (engwebp); the deuterocanonical books come from the
  World English Bible edition that includes them (eng-web), public domain.
- **Greek** – Septuagint (grcbrent), public domain. **Latin** – Clementine Vulgate, public domain.
- Books a version doesn't have show "This Bible doesn't include this book". Where traditions number
  verses differently (e.g. the Vulgate's Tobit and Sirach follow another text), verses show as gaps
  rather than being forced into line. The Greek additions to Esther, 1 Enoch (R.H. Charles 1917) and
  the Gospel of Thomas follow later.

## Tanakh (Judaism, added Nov 2026)

Torah, Nevi'im and Ketuvim in Jewish book order and Hebrew verse numbering (e.g. Malachi 3:19–24,
Joel 4, psalm titles as verse 1).
- **JPS 1917** – The Holy Scriptures according to the Masoretic Text, Jewish Publication Society of
  America, 1917; public domain in the US (published before 1931). Source: eBible.org (engjps). eBible
  stores it in English numbering with the Hebrew reference marked; `scripts/import-tanakh.ts` restores
  the Hebrew numbering from those markers.
- **MT** – Westminster Leningrad Codex (eBible.org hebwlc), public domain.
- The Ten Commandments (Exodus 20, Deuteronomy 5), Psalm 70 and Nehemiah 7 are divided into verses
  differently in the two editions; those verses show as gaps rather than being forced into line.

## Dhammapada (Buddhism, added Nov 2026)

26 chapters (vaggas), traditional verse numbers 1–423.
- **Sujato** – "Sayings of the Dhamma", translated by Bhikkhu Sujato; **Pāli** – Mahāsaṅgīti edition.
  Both from SuttaCentral's bilara-data, dedicated to the public domain (CC0):
  https://github.com/suttacentral/bilara-data (`scripts/import-dhammapada.ts`).

## Pali Canon / Tipiṭaka (Buddhism, added Nov 2026)

Sutta Pitaka (DN, MN, SN 1–56, AN 1–11, and the Khuddaka books Kp, Ud, Iti, Snp, Thag, Thig), Vinaya
Pitaka (Pātimokkhas, Vibhaṅgas, Khandhaka, Parivāra) and Abhidhamma Pitaka (7 books), from SuttaCentral's
bilara-data, all dedicated to the public domain (CC0) (`scripts/import-tipitaka.ts`):
- **English** – Bhikkhu Sujato (Sutta Pitaka) and Bhikkhu Brahmali (Vinaya Pitaka).
- **Pāli** – Mahāsaṅgīti Tipiṭaka edition (root text).
- **No English Abhidhamma**: every English translation (PTS and others) is still under copyright, so the
  Abhidhamma is shown in Pāli only, with a note saying why.

## The Quran (Islam, added Nov 2026)

114 surahs in the standard (Hafs) verse numbering.
- **Arabic** – Tanzil Quran Text (Uthmani), © Tanzil Project, CC BY 3.0, https://tanzil.net/ . Shown
  verbatim as the licence requires (search ignores vowel marks internally, but the text is never changed).
- **Pickthall** – "The Meaning of the Glorious Koran", Marmaduke Pickthall (Alfred A. Knopf, 1930);
  public domain in the US since 1 January 2026 (published 1930). Text from Wikisource's proofread
  transcription of the 1930 edition (79 surahs) and, for the rest, the Internet Archive scan's text layer
  (MN40248ucmf_9), cleaned of page headers and footnotes (`scripts/import-quran.ts`).
  Pickthall's 1930 numbering differs from the standard in places (e.g. Surah 6 has 166 verses); verses are
  matched to the standard numbering by content (lengths against the Arabic) and his own number is shown.
  A few verse numbers are unreadable in the scan: those verses show as a gap or as part of the previous
  verse until Wikisource's proofreading covers them (re-run the import to pick that up).
  Tanzil's translation files are non-commercial, so no text is taken from them.

## Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (Yoga, added Nov 2026)

- **Johnston** – "The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: The Book of the Spiritual Man", translated by Charles
  Johnston (1912), public domain, Project Gutenberg #2526. Four books (Samadhi, Sadhana, Vibhuti,
  Kaivalya; 51 + 55 + 55 + 34 sutras). Only the sutras are included, not Johnston's commentary.
  A Sanskrit text will be added once a public-domain source is confirmed.

## Bhagavad Gita (Hinduism, added Nov 2026)

18 chapters, 700 verses (standard numbering). Both versions come from Wikisource's proofread
transcription of Annie Besant's translation, 4th edition (1922, public domain in the US), which prints
each verse in Sanskrit and English (`scripts/import-gita.ts`):
- **Besant** – English, Annie Besant. Her footnotes are not included.
- **Sanskrit** – the Devanagari text as printed in that edition.

## Hatha Yoga Pradipika (Yoga, added Nov 2026)

4 chapters; Pancham Sinh's translation (1914, public domain), from the Internet Sacred Text Archive's
transcription (`scripts/import-hyp.ts`). English only: the site's Sanskrit is an experimental
conversion its editor says doesn't line up with the book.

## 1 Enoch and the Gospel of Thomas (Christianity, added Nov 2026)

- **1 Enoch** – R. H. Charles' translation (1917, public domain), 108 chapters, from the Internet Sacred
  Text Archive (`scripts/import-enoch.ts`). His editorial brackets and footnotes are left out.
- **Gospel of Thomas** – Mark M. Mattison's translation from the Coptic, which he committed to the
  public domain (gospels.net/thomas), 114 sayings (`scripts/import-thomas.ts`).

## Mishnah (Judaism, added Nov 2026)

All six orders, 63 tractates, via Sefaria's API (`scripts/import-mishnah.ts`):
- **Kulp** – "Mishnah Yomit" English translation by Dr. Joshua Kulp, CC BY (credit shown with the text).
- **Hebrew** – Mishnah, ed. Romm, Vilna 1913, public domain. (Bikkurim chapter 4, a later addition,
  isn't in this edition; that chapter shows a note.)

## Talmud Bavli (Judaism, added Nov 2026)

The 37 tractates of the six orders via Sefaria's API (`scripts/import-talmud.ts`); chapter = folio (daf),
each segment labelled "2a:3":
- **Talmud** – Hebrew/Aramaic text, Wikisource edition, **CC BY-SA** (credit shown; shared under the
  same licence).
- **Cohen** – English for Berakhot only: A. Cohen, Cambridge University Press 1921, public domain.
- **Davidson** – English for all 37 tractates: the William Davidson digital edition of the Koren Noé
  Talmud (Rabbi Adin Even-Israel Steinsaltz), **CC BY-NC** via Sefaria — credit shown; allowed because
  Verses Across is non-commercial (free forever, no ads). The bold literal translation and the
  explanation woven into it are shown together as plain text.

## Hadith (Islam, added Nov 2026)

Nine collections in Arabic — Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Sunan Abi Dawud, Jami at-Tirmidhi,
Sunan an-Nasa'i, Sunan Ibn Majah, Muwatta Malik, and the Forty Hadith of an-Nawawi and Qudsi — from
the open hadith-api project (fawazahmed0, The Unlicense; the classical Arabic itself is public domain)
(`scripts/import-hadith.ts`). No English: the usual translations (Muhsin Khan, Siddiqui, …) are still
under copyright; every chapter says so.

## Upanishads (Hinduism, added Nov 2026)

Twelve Upanishads (Isha, Kena, Katha, Prashna, Mundaka, Taittiriya, Aitareya Aranyaka, Chandogya,
Brihadaranyaka, Svetasvatara, Kaushitaki, Maitrayaniya) in F. Max Müller's translation, Sacred Books of
the East vols. 1 (1879) and 15 (1884), public domain, from the Internet Sacred Text Archive
(`scripts/import-upanishads.ts`). Footnotes are left out. (Müller didn't translate the Mandukya.)

## Ramayana (Hinduism, added Nov 2026)

Ralph T. H. Griffith's verse translation, "The Rámáyan of Válmíki" (1870–74, public domain), six books,
from the Internet Sacred Text Archive (`scripts/import-ramayana.ts`). Griffith doesn't number stanzas:
verses are his stanzas in order (long ones split at a sentence end). Footnotes are left out.

## Vedas (Hinduism, added Nov 2026)

Ralph T. H. Griffith's translations (public domain), from the Internet Sacred Text Archive
(`scripts/import-vedas.ts`): Rig Veda (1896, 10 books, hymn = chapter), Sama Veda (1895), White Yajur
Veda / Vajasaneyi Samhita (1899, 40 books), Atharva Veda (1895–96, 20 books). English only: the site's
Sanskrit is a machine conversion with errors.

## Mahabharata (Hinduism, added Nov 2026)

Kisari Mohan Ganguli's prose translation (1883–96, public domain), all 18 books, from the Internet Sacred
Text Archive (`scripts/import-mahabharata.ts`). Chapter = Ganguli's section; verse = paragraph.
Footnotes are left out.
